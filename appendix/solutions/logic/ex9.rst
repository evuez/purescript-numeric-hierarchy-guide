Exercise 1.9
============

One example of an :math:`x \in \mathbb{R}` for which :math:`x < x^2` is not
true is :math:`\frac{1}{2}`; squaring :math:`\frac{1}{2}` gives you
:math:`\frac{1}{4}`.

In fact, for any :math:`x` satisfying :math:`0 \leq x \leq 1`, we will have
that :math:`x \geq x^2`; this is perhaps best illustrated by plotting :math:`y
= x` and :math:`y = x^2` on a graph:

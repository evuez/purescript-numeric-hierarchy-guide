Exercise 1.8
============

If we start with an equation, we are allowed to do the same thing to both
sides, and we will get another equation which also holds.

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us

.. math::

  3x = 13 - 4

  3x = 9

Now we can divide both sides by 3:

.. math::

  x = 3

So we can choose :math:`x` to be :math:`3` as a suitable value to illustrate
the truth of this statement. In fact :math:`3` is the only suitable value in
this case. Note, however, that not all equations have exactly one solution:
some have zero, some have 2 or more, and some have infinitely many.

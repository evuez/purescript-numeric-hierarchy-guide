Exercise 1.7
============

If we take the contrapositive of the statement

.. math::

  x^2 \text{ is odd} \Rightarrow x \text{ is odd}

then we should end up with

.. math::

  x \text{ is not odd} \Rightarrow x^2 \text{ is not odd}.

A more sensible way of saying ":math:`x` is not odd" is to say ":math:`x` is
even", so this statement is equivalent to the statement

.. math::

  x \text{ is even} \Rightarrow x^2 \text{ is even}.

And we've already proved that this is true, so we are done!

Exercise 6.2
============

Let :math:`R` be a ring, and suppose :math:`1` is a zero-divisor. That is,
there exists a :math:`b \in R` with :math:`b \neq 0` such that :math:`1 \cdot b
= 0` or :math:`b \cdot 1 = 0`. But :math:`1 \cdot b = b \cdot 1 = b` since
:math:`1` is the multiplicative identity. So :math:`b = 0`, but this is a
contradiction. Therefore :math:`1` cannot be a zero-divisor.

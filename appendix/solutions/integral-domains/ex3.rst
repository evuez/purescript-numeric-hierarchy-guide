Exercise 6.3
============

The ring :math:`\mathbb{Z}_8` is commutative, so our only option to show that
it is not an integral domain is to show that it has a zero-divisor. There are
in fact three zero-divisors in :math:`\mathbb{Z}_8`: they are
:math:`\overline{2}, \overline{4},` and :math:`\overline{6}`. Each of these
yields :math:`\overline{0}` when multiplied by :math:`\overline{4}`.

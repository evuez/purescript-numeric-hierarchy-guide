Exercise 6.4
============

Suppose :math:`m \geq 2` and :math:`\mathbb{Z}_m` has a zero-divisor. That is,
there exist integers :math:`a, b` such that :math:`\overline{a} \neq
\overline{0}, \overline{b} \neq \overline{0},` and :math:`\overline{ab} =
\overline{0},` or equivalently, neither :math:`a` nor :math:`b` is a multiple
of :math:`m`, but :math:`ab` is. The only way this can happen is if :math:`m`
is composite i.e. not prime, as in this case there must exist integers :math:`1
< k, l < m` with :math:`kl = m` such that :math:`k` divides :math:`a` and
:math:`l` divides :math:`b`.

Conversely, suppose :math:`m \geq 2` and :math:`\mathbb{Z}_m` is an integral
domain, i.e. it has no zero-divisors. That is, for any integers :math:`a, b`
with :math:`1 < a, b < m,` we have that :math:`ab` is not a multiple of
:math:`m`. The only way this can happen is if :math:`m` is prime.

Therefore, :math:`\mathbb{Z}_m` is an integral domain if and only if :math:`m`
is prime.

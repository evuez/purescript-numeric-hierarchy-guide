Exercise 3.2
============

Let :math:`(G, *)` be a group. We are looking for an :math:`e^{-1} \in G` such
that :math:`e * e^{-1} = e^{-1} * e = e` (remember that inverses are unique, so
there must be exactly one such :math:`e^{-1}`).

By the monoid identity law (remember all groups are monoids), we have that
:math:`e * e = e`, so the inverse of the identity must be the identity itself.

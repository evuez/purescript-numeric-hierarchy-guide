Exercise 3.4
============

Part a)
-------

Essentially, we are looking for an integer that solves :math:`3 + x = 2`, which
is clearly :math:`x = -1`. So the answer is :math:`\overline{-1}`. However, it
is customary to use a number between :math:`0` and :math:`m - 1` as the
representative for an element of :math:`\mathbb{Z}_m`. Remember that
:math:`\overline{x} = \overline{x + 12}`, so in particular :math:`\overline{-1}
= \overline{11}`. So we write the answer as :math:`\overline{11}`.

Part b)
-------

The procedure is similar to part a); we are looking for an integer that solves
:math:`5 + x = 0`, which is clearly :math:`x = -5`, giving us the answer
:math:`\overline{-5} = \overline{7}`.

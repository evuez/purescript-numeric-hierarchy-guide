Exercise 2.2
============

We first check the closure law for :math:`(\mathbb{Q}, +)`. Suppose we have two
arbitrary elements of :math:`\mathbb{Q}`; we can write them as
:math:`\frac{a}{b}` and :math:`\frac{c}{d}`, where :math:`a, b, c, d \in
\mathbb{Z}`.

Then:

.. math::

  \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} &= \frac{ad}{bd} + \frac{bc}{bd} \\
                            &= \frac{ad + bc}{bd}.

We have an integer on the top and an integer on the bottom, so the result of
adding these two values is in :math:`\mathbb{Q}`, and therefore the closure
law is satisfied.

We could check associativity similarly to how we checked closure, but we
already know that addition is associative for all real numbers; since the
rational numbers are a subset of the real numbers, we can simply conclude that
the associativity law holds for :math:`(\mathbb{Q}, +)`.

The identity element in :math:`(\mathbb{Q}, +)` is 0, just like in
:math:`(\mathbb{Z}, +)` and in :math:`(\mathbb{R}, +)`.

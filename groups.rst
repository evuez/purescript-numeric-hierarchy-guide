I will start with a set which you're probably already very familiar with: the
integers. As you probably know, integers can be added together and multiplied,
with quite a few rules which are probably intuitive to you. Here are some rules
for how addition works:

* If $x$ and $y$ are integers, then $x + y$ is always another integer.
* $x + 0$ is always the same as $x$, and so is $0 + x$.
* For any integer $x$, there is another integer $-x$, so that $x + (-x) = 0$.
* It doesn't matter what order you bracket up additions. So for any integers
  $x, y, z,$ we have that $(x + y) + z$ is always the same as $x + (y + z)$.

Good. Now we will look at another example. Consider this triangle:

Notice that the vertices are labelled A, B, and C.
